# BM: Backup-maker
An upgraded version of OS-Backup-for-Raspberry. Now compatible with all Linux systems. This script can avoid the unintentional erase of data using colors to warn the user where he wants to save the backup and minimalize the typical human errors or neglects in the making a backup
This script cant avoid completly the human errors, its just to minimalize that errors!!
